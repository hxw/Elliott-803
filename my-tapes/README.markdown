# Old programs that I wrote at Loughborough Grammar School

There is an old photo here http://www.g6lvb.com/803.htm


## cd4007 (source tape)

Source to a drawing of a CMOS CD4007 IC.  This used a plotter drawing
language created by Peter Tilsley.


## ch-osl (T2 source tape)

A program to dump memory as machine code to paper tape punch in a form
that should be compatible with T2.

## issue-7-binarise (T2 source tape)

not sure


## plotter-osl (H-Code (machine code) source tape)

A program to dump memory and write the machine code on the plotter.

This seems to be using the H-Code compiler to translate the machine code
rather than T2, but could be missing ":LIST" at the start.


# plotter-writing (binary tape)

Read any source tape and write it on the plotter, I remember this as
being a little faster that using the teleprinter to print source
tapes.  By taping A4 paper to the plotter drum you could get output on
that.


# tpso (T2 source tape)

A program to dump memory and printthe machine code on the teleprinter.
