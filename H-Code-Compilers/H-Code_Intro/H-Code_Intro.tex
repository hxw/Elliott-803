\section{\myuline{COMPUTERS}}

We are concerned with \myuline{automatic electronic digital computers}.
A \myuline{digital computer} handles numbers
in the form of a series of digits, such as
one does when doing a calculation by hand.  For
example, the number 53 might be represented by a gearwheel
turned through five teeth, and another turned
through three teeth or, alternatively, by two trains
of pulses containing 5 and 3 pulses respectively.
The precision of such machines can be increased
indefinitely merely by allowing for a sufficiently
large number of digits In the number.

This is in contrast to \myuline{analogue computers} in
which numbers are represented by some physical
quantity, such as length, angle or electrical
potential, and in which arithmetical operations on
such numbers are performed by using some law of
Physics, e.g. Ohm's Law, and then making a measurement
to find the answer.  A slide rule is an example
of an analogue computer: here the logarithms of
numbers are proportional to lengths; these lengths
are added and subtracted mechanically to give lengths
proportional to the logarithms of products and
quotients.

The accuracy of an analogue computer is limited by
the precision with which the physical quantity used can
be measured; whereas the accuracy of a digital computer
depends only on the number of digits allocated to a
number in the machine. This facility which allows
calculation to a large number of significant figures can
be most important.  Even if the raw data of a problem
1s given only to three decimal digits and the results
are only required to that accuracy, rounding-off errors
(e.g. subtraction of two large nearly equal quantities)
may build up invalidating the final result.  Most
electronic digital computers work with numbers of 11
decimal digits accuracy.

The drawback with a digital computer is that all
operations take place serially and, therefore, calculation
time may in certain cases build up appreciably in
spite of the very fast speed of electronic computation.
Furthermore, in order to solve a problem using
digital computer, the mathematical solution has, in
general, to be known completely whereas analogue computers
only require the formulation of the problem.

\section{\myuline{INTRODUCTION TO PROGRAMMING}}

\subsection{PROGRAMME}

A \myuline{digital computer} is a general-purpose machine.
It is prepared for a particular job by feeding into
it a \myuline{programme}, or list of instructions.  This
programme is stored within the \myuline{memory} or \myuline{store} of the
computer.  It is important to realise that it is
only when a computer has got a programme within it,
that it becomes a usable machine.

Because it is the programme which makes a
computer do a particular job, it follows that it is
only necessary to feed in a different programme to
prepare the computer for a different type of work;
there is no need to make any changes to the computer
itself.  This is one reason why it is possible for so
many people to do such a variety of work on one
machine.  No matter what the machine was doing
previously, it is immediately set up to do your
particular job when you feed in your programme.

When a programme is fed into a computer, the
\myuline{whole} programme goes in and is stored before the
computer begins to obey the instructions of the
programme.  The instructions are \myuline{NOT}, repeat \myuline{NOT},
obeyed as they are read in.  This is a very important
idea, even though it is quite simple.  Each programme
is designed to do a particular \myuline{type} of work.  When the
programme has been stored in the computer, the instructions
are then obeyed one by one, and one of the first
instructions will be to read and store the \myuline{data for the
particular job being done}.  Thus the same programme may
be used several times with different sets of data,
without reading in the programme each time.

The computer, having stored the data it
requires, then continues to work through the
instructions of the programme, taking items of stored
information, producing and storing intermediate
results and finally producing the answers.  These are
then punched on to paper tape for subsequent printing
on a teleprinter page, attention being paid to the
layout in columns and the insertion of headings where
desirable.

\subsection{TACKLING THE PROBLEM}

It is important to realise that a computer is a
pure automaton.  It has no intelligence, no initiative
and no capacity for dealing with unforeseen
circumstances.  This means that the programme must
be written in such a way that every possibility is
catered for and the programmer must foresee any
exceptional cases that could arise.

When preparing a problem (programming) for a
computer the procedure is as follows:â€”

\renewcommand{\labelenumi}{\ifnum\value{enumi}=1 Stage (\roman{enumi})\else (\roman{enumi})\fi}
\begin{enumerate}

\item The problem and the solution of the
problem suitable for computing, must
first be \myuline{precisely} defined.  In
mathematical problems this is
probably done in she mathematical
statement of the problem, but in
other problems, particularly those
involving logical decisions, this
first stage may, in fact, be a
considerable part of the work.

\item We must assign a letter of the
alphabet and numerical suffix to
each variable which occurs in the
calculation.  (see Section \ref{sec:STORNUM})

\item The steps of the problem are written
down in the form of a \myuline{flow diagram}
(see below)

\item The flow diagram has to be converted
to a form (or code) that the computer
can understand.  Using the Brush
Automatic Coding Scheme, this is done
quite simply, using a code which
resembles normal mathematical and
logical statements.

\item When the programme has been written,
it has to be put into a form which
can be "read" by the computer.  This
is done with a teleprinter which
produces a punched paper tape and a
typed sheet with a copy of the
programme.

\hspace{1em} Each time a number, letter or
symbol is printed, a corresponding
combination of up to 5 holes is
punched across the tape, and these
holes can be sensed by the photoelectric
tape-readers on the computer.
The information on this programme tape
is read in by the computer, automatically
converted to a form suitable to
it, and stored.

\hspace{1em} The numbers involved in the
calculation (data) are similarly
punched on a paper tape, referred to
as the \myuline{data tape}.  This is usually a
separate tape, but it may be attached
to the end of the programme tape.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{flushleft}
EXAMPLE OF FLOW DIAGRAM.
\end{flushleft}

The computer is to read a list of numbers (A),
one by one, form and print  $1 / \sqrt{A}$ and stop when a
negative number is encountered.  If $A = 0$ then print
"No solution" and read the next number.

A possible flow diagram for this very trivial
problem would be:

\section{\myuline{THE BRUSH AUTOMATIC CODING SCHEME - H-CODE}}

\subsection{STORAGE OF NUMBERS} \label{sec:STORNUM}

The operation of the computer can be visualised
by thinking of it as a huge collection of pigeon-holes
called \myuline{storage-locations} or simply \myuline{locations}.
Problems are solved on the computer by simple basic
arithmetical and logical operations on data which has
been stored in convenient locations.

In the Brush automatic coding scheme (\myuline{H-Code})
the stored numbers are identified \myuline{symbolically}.  While
the programme is being written it is inappropriate to
consider the values of the numbers, they will in fact
be different each time the programme is used.  A
symbolic form is therefore required and it is, of
course, similar to simple algebraic notation.

A number in a location is referred to by any
letter of the alphabet together with a numerical
suffix (if needed) e.g.

$A_{13}$, $B_{16}$, $C$, $Z_{2}$.

$C$ is understood to be equivalent to $C_{0}$.

$A, A_{1}, A_{2} - - - - A_{13}$ etc., etc., will be
consecutive locations in the machine.  It is not up
to the programmer to allocate particular locations in
the machine to a particular letter.  This is done
automatically.  It is sufficient to tell the machine
that $A_{0} - A_{45}$, $B_{0} - B_{50}$ etc., are required and the
computer will do the actual allocating.

There are two types of numbers used by the
computer:-

\renewcommand{\labelenumi}{(\alph{enumi})}
\begin{enumerate}

\item \myuline{Floating-point variables} or simply \myuline{variables}

These usually refer to physical quantities
etc., and are of any form, integral, fractional, or
mixed mumbers within the approximate range $\pm 10^{77} - \pm 10^{-77}$

\item \myuline{Fixed-point variables, suffices, integerâ€”variables},
or simply \myuline{integers}

These are used mainly for counting and
organisation of the programme.  They are whole numbers
i.e. integers and exist within the approximate range
$0 - \pm 10^{12}$
\end{enumerate}

Except under special circumstances, variables
and integers cannot be mixed in arithmetic statements.

It is now apparent that not only do we have to
tell the machine how many locations we have to use for
a particular letter but also whether the letter is to
represent a \myuline{variable} or an \myuline{integer}.

The actual instructions in H-Code which appear
at the beginning of the programme are, for example

\begin{addmargin}[1cm]{1em}%
\begin{lstlisting}
:SETV (A50, B3, C, X1)
:SETS (N13, L2, T)
\end{lstlisting}
\end{addmargin}

On reading these the computer will allocate \myuline{51}
locations to be identified as $A, A_{1}, A_{2} - - - - A_{50}$
and to be understood to be variables.  Similarly for
$B$, $C$ and $X$.

Under \mytt{SETS} the letters will similarly identify
locations which will hold integers.

If a letter is set to be a variable it cannot
also be an integer and vice-versa.

However, as explained above, it is of no
concern to the programmer which locations are actually
allocated to the variables or integers.  His only
concern is that a number placed in location $A_{10}$(say) in
one part of the programme will have the same value when
$A_{10}$ is referred to later, unless changed by a step in
the programme itself.

\subsection{THE NAMING OF PROGRAMMES}

In H-Code a number of independently written
programmes (or \myuline{procedures}) can be used together, with
the restriction that all use the same variables and
integers.

In order that we can refer to and use one
programme inside another, we give to each procedure a
name (consisting of letters only).

So that the computer is prepared to understand
reference to a procedure and to receive a procedure
when put into the computer, we have to set the
procedure names in the same way as we have set the
variables and integers.
Example:

\begin{addmargin}[1cm]{1em}%
\begin{lstlisting}
:SETR (LTV, DESIGN 6, ENDW 3)
\end{lstlisting}
\end{addmargin}

The number appearing after the name is a
reference number.  This is explained in \ref{sec:REFJMP}

\subsection{THE PROGRAM}

The set statements (\mytt{SETV}, \mytt{SETS}, \mytt{SETR}) are
merely directives to the machine to reserve locations
for programmes or procedures of given names written
with specified variables and integers.

After the sets, the Computer is in a position
to receive the programme.  This programme it
translates and \myuline{stores} in a form which it can
subsequently be obeyed.

Each procedure is headed by a statement
indicating to the machine the name of the procedure.
It is written e.g.

\begin{addmargin}[1cm]{1em}%
\begin{lstlisting}
:DEFINE (DESIGN)
\end{lstlisting}
\end{addmargin}

The actual orders of the procedure \mytt{DESIGN} then
follow.

The name in the \mytt{DEFINE} statement will have been
set in the \mytt{SETR} instruction, as will all the subsequent
procedures.

\subsection{ARITHMETIC} \label{sec:ARITH}

In the computer arithmetical operations
(\mytt{+}, \mytt{-}, \mytt{*}, \mytt{/}, See note(i) below\footnotemark[1]) take place only between
numbers in the storage locations and the number in a
special location called an \myuline{accumulator}.  For example,
if we want to add two numbers together, one of the
numbers must first be transferred from the store to the
accumulator, and the other added to it.  The result of
any operation is always in the accumlator.

\footnotetext[1]{
N.B. (i) $*$ is used for the multiplication sign.  As
well as distinguishing it from a letter $x$ it is the
teleprinter symbol for X (presumably for the same
reason).}

In order that the computer be efficiently and
quickly programmed, the form of the arithmetic in
H-Code follows this principle of accumulator working,
so that If we write the following statement in our
programme:

\begin{addmargin}[1cm]{1em}%
\begin{lstlisting}
A + B * C â†’ Y
\end{lstlisting}
\end{addmargin}

the computer translates it operation by operation viz.

\begin{tabular}{lp{5cm}}
$A$  & Bring $c(A)$ into ACC (see note (ii) below\footnotemark[2]) \\
$+B$ & Add $c(B)$ to ACC giving $c(A)+c(B)$ in ACC \\
$*C$ & Multiply $c(ACC$) by $c(C)$ giving \\
     & $[c(A)+c(B)]*c(C)$ in ACC \\
$\rightarrow Y$ & Send the $c(ACC)$ to $Y$ giving $c(Y)=[c(A)+c(B)]*c(C)$
\end{tabular}

\footnotetext[2]{
(ii) $c(A)$ means "the contents of location A".  ACC
stands for "the accumulator" and $c(ACC)$ "the contents
of the accumlator".}

i.e. in mathematical terms we have written a programme
to calculate

\begin{math}
Y = (A+B)C
\end{math}

As we can see, this does not correspond \myuline{exactly} to standard
mathematical conventions, but \myuline{if desired} we can put in
suitable brackets i.e.

\begin{addmargin}[1cm]{1em}%
\begin{lstlisting}
(A + B) * C â†’ Y
\end{lstlisting}
\end{addmargin}

These brackets are ignored by the computer but they
must occur in pairs.  This principle of accumulator
working is extended to functions so that if we wanted
an order in a programme to calculate

\begin{addmargin}[1cm]{1em}%
\begin{math}
Y = Ae^{\sqrt{BX+C}}
\end{math}
\end{addmargin}

we would write

\begin{addmargin}[1cm]{1em}%
\begin{lstlisting}
(B * X + C):SQRT:EXP * A â†’ Y
\end{lstlisting}
\end{addmargin}

which, step by step, is:-

\begin{tabular}{lp{5cm}}
$($   & Ignored \\
$B$   & $c(B) \rightarrow ACC$ \\
$*X$  & $c(ACC) * c(X) \rightarrow ACC$ \\
$+C$  & $c(ACC) + c(C) \rightarrow ACC$ \\
$)$   & Ignored \\
:SQRT & Square root of $c(ACC) \rightarrow ACC$ \\
:EXP  & Exponential of $c(ACC) \rightarrow ACC$ \\
$*A$  & $c(ACC) * c(A) \rightarrow ACC$ \\
$\rightarrow Y$ & $c(ACC) \rightarrow Y$ \\
\end{tabular}

(We put a colon (:) before words in the
programme to distinguish English from letters which
refer to locations)

This simple method of indicating to the
computer the mathematical formulae it has to calculate
can be applied to innumerable equations.  However, if
we have an equation such as:-

\begin{addmargin}[1cm]{1em}%
\begin{math}
Y = ab + cd
\end{math}
\end{addmargin}

it cannot be programmed in one expression with the
facilities mentioned so far.  This is because after
multiplying a and b together, the result is in the
accumulator and this has to be added to the product of
c and d.  Clearly, this second multiplication has to
be performed using the accumulator, therefore the first
product has to be stored away temporarily.  In our
programme, we can write this as:â€”

\begin{addmargin}[1cm]{1em}%
\begin{lstlisting}
A * B + (C * D) â†’ Y
\end{lstlisting}
\end{addmargin}

In this case the brackets are most important and
indicate to the computer that the quantity in
brackets must be computed separately.

step by step this is:-

\begin{tabular}{lp{5.5cm}}
$A$  & $c(A) \rightarrow ACC$ \\
$*B$ & $c(ACC)*c(B) \rightarrow ACC$ \\
$+($ & $c(ACC) \rightarrow$ Special storage location $X_{1}$ \\
$C$  & $c(C) \rightarrow ACC$ \\
$*D$ & $c(ACC)*c(D) \rightarrow ACC$ \\
$)$  & $c(ACC)+c(X_{1}) \rightarrow ACC$ \\
$\rightarrow Y$ & $c(ACC) \rightarrow Y$ \\
\end{tabular}

We can extend this facility to any depth
effectively e.g. the instruction to calculate:â€”

\begin{addmargin}[1cm]{1em}%
\begin{math}
Y = A/\sqrt{AB+CD}
\end{math}
\end{addmargin}

is written

\begin{addmargin}[1cm]{1em}%
\begin{lstlisting}
A/((A * B + (C * D)):SQRT) â†’ Y
\end{lstlisting}
\end{addmargin}

The outer pair of brackets are \myuline{necessary} to
indicate that the contents are to be calculated
separately.

The inner pair of brackets are \myuline{necessary} to
indicate that $C * D$ is to be computed separately.

But the brackets around $A * B + (C * D)$ are
\myuline{not necessary} as the result of this computation is in
the accumulator and we can immediately take the square
root of it.  They are merely put in to "clarify" the
statement.

If a pair of brackets is immediately preceded
by \mytt{+} \mytt{-} \mytt{*} or \mytt{/} then the expression between the brackets
is computed separately.  If not preceded by one of
these operators then the pair of brackets are ignored.

N.B. Note that in the preceding examples,
and those that follow wherever we have used A, B, C
etc, we could as well have used:

\begin{addmargin}[1cm]{1em}%
$A_{13}$, $B_{56}$, $C_{2}$, . . etc.
\end{addmargin}

Also variables can be replaced by mixed
number constants e.g. 167.63, 123.0 etc.

Integers can be replaced by integer
constants e.g. 3, 176 etc.  Numbers which are
variables should always have a decimal point.  Numbers
which are integers should never have a decimal point.


\subsection{REFERENCE NUMBERS AND JUMP INSTRUCTIONS}\label{sec:REFJMP}

In a programme, the instructions are usually
obeyed in the sequence in which they are written.  The
\myuline{jump instructions}, however, enable this sequence to be
broken and can specify which instruction is to be
obeyed next at a particular point in the programme.

To do this, it is necessary to be able to
identify the instruction to which the jump has to go.
This is done by \myuline{labelling}.  A \myuline{label} or \myuline{reference number}
is a positive integer constant written with a
bracket, before the instruction e.g.

\begin{addmargin}[1cm]{1em}%
\begin{lstlisting}
3) A + B â†’ Y
\end{lstlisting}
\end{addmargin}

The simplest jump instruction is written:e.g.

\begin{addmargin}[1cm]{1em}%
\begin{lstlisting}
:GOTO 7
\end{lstlisting}
\end{addmargin}

This means that the next instruction to be
obeyed is that with reference number 7.

Jump instructions may be made \myuline{conditional}
on some equality or inequality e.g. we can write:

\begin{addmargin}[1cm]{1em}%
\begin{lstlisting}
:IF ( A + B > X:SIN) GOTO 9
\end{lstlisting}
\end{addmargin}

This means "obey the instruction with
reference number 9 if a + b is greater than sin x
and continue the sequence from there, otherwise go on
to the next instruction as usual".

Any arithmetical quantities can be compared
and \mytt{>} can be replaced by:-

\begin{addmargin}[1cm]{1em}%
$<$, $=$, $\ngtr$, $\nless$, $\ne$.
\end{addmargin}

In the \mytt{SETR} instruction which appears at the
head of the programme, we have to suffix each routine
name with the highest reference number or label which
is going to occur in that particular routine.  This
is so that the computer can reserve locations for the
organisation of the reference numbers.

Each individual routine has its own reference
numbers, i.e. if reference 3 occurs in a particular
routine it has no connection with reference 3 in
another routine.

\subsection{INPUT AND OUTPUT OF NUMBERS}

The Instruction

\begin{addmargin}[1cm]{1em}%
\begin{lstlisting}
:READ (A,B,C,D,E)
\end{lstlisting}
\end{addmargin}

is used to read numbers punched on paper tape.  When
it is obeyed the computer will read the first number
on the data tape and store it in location A, the second
in B etc.

When the computer has finished the calculation
it has to communicate its results to the outside world.
It punches the requisite numbers on to paper tape which
is then fed into a teleprinter which produces a
typewritten copy of the numbers.

The order in the programme which instructs
the computer to do this is typified by:

\begin{addmargin}[1cm]{1em}%
\begin{lstlisting}
C : 2.4 or even (B + A) : 5.3
\end{lstlisting}
\end{addmargin}

in the second example \mytt{(B + A)} is formed in
the accumulator and \mytt{:5.3} signifies that the number in
the accumulator 1s to be punched out with up to 5
digits before the decimal point and 3 after it.

Any characters which appear in the body of
the programme between inverted commas e.g.

\begin{addmargin}[1cm]{1em}%
\begin{lstlisting}
'LBS/FT.3'
\end{lstlisting}
\end{addmargin}

will be punched on the output tape when the order is
obeyed.  This facility is normally used in conjunction
with the above number print in order to give
explanation and layout to the numerical answers.

\subsection{LOOPS OF INSTRUCTIONS}

An essential feature of using a digital
computer is that repetitive processes are used.  In
this way, a group of instructions which are only
written once may be used repeatedly during the
calculation, probably operating on different numbers
each time.

In H-Code the instructions (or rather pairs
of instructions) which facilitate the use of repetitive
processes are, for example:â€”

\renewcommand{\labelenumi}{(\roman{enumi})}
\begin{enumerate}
\def\theenumi{\roman{enumi}}

\item\label{it:LOOP} \ \vspace{-1.5ex}
\begin{lstlisting}
:LOOP
      } programme to be obeyed
      } repetitively
:REPEAT
\end{lstlisting}

The programme between the \mytt{:LOOP} and \mytt{:REPEAT} is
obeyed repetitively. That is after the \mytt{:REPEAT} control
goes back automatically to the instruction immediately
following the \mytt{:LOOP} instruction.

\item\label{it:COND} \ \vspace{-1.5ex}
\begin{lstlisting}
:LOOP
      } programme to be obeyed
      } repetitively
:IF (A<C) REPEAT
\end{lstlisting}

This is similar to (\ref{it:LOOP}) but the \mytt{:REPEAT} is
conditional.  The range of conditions is the same as
a conditional \mytt{:GOTO} instruction.

\item\label{it:DO} \ \vspace{-1.5ex}
\begin{lstlisting}
:DO (5)
      } Programme to be obeyed
      } 5 times
:REPEAT
\end{lstlisting}

The programme between the \mytt{:DO} and \mytt{:REPEAT} is
obeyed 5 times or more generally, obeyed the number of
times specified by the \mytt{:DO} instruction.  The \mytt{:REPEAT}
\myuline{must} be unconditional.
\end{enumerate}

Loops can occur with each other and are
paired as shown in the following example:â€”

\begingroup

\makebox{%
\begin{picture}(70,50)

\put(8,38){\vector(1,0){8}}

\put(10,23){\line(0,-1){9}}
\put(10,14){\line(1,0){6}}

\end{picture}}
\endgroup


A \mytt{:REPEAT} is paired with the last unpaired
\mytt{:LOOP} or \mytt{:DO}.  Other programme can occur anywhere
between the \mytt{:DO}s, \mytt{:LOOP}s, and \mytt{:REPEAT}s.

\subsection{AUTOMATIC SELECTION OF NUMBERS;MODIFICATION}

Often during a computation, we require to
work systematically through sets of mumbers stored as
variables in the computer.  To do this, we require
the methods of programming mentioned in the previous
section but we also need to be able to select in turn
a succession of variables, referring to a different
variable each time we go round the loop.

This technique is made possible by being able
to write:

$A_{N}$ (punched as \mytt{AN} or \mytt{A (N)} )

instead of e.g. $A_{3}$, when referring to a variable.  When
the programme is obeyed the computer uses the current
value of \mytt{N} to determine the particular \mytt{A} which is to be
used.

So if we write:

\begin{addmargin}[1cm]{1em}%
\begin{math}
A_{N} \rightarrow X
\end{math}
\end{addmargin}

and on obeying this order $N=3$ then the actual order
obeyed is

\begin{addmargin}[1cm]{1em}%
\begin{math}
A_{3} \rightarrow X
\end{math}
\end{addmargin}

$A$ can be a variable or an integer, but $N$
must be an integer.

An integer used in this way is called a
\myuline{modifier}.

To obtain a \myuline{succession} of values the $N$ (say)
is modified inside the loop so that $A_{N}$ will refer to
another variable next time around.

This technique of modification is one of the
most valuable features available in a computer.

To illustrate this, we give an example:

Form $C_{i} = A_{i} + B_{i}, for i = 0 (1) 99$ i.e. $i$ takes all
the values from 0 to 99 in steps of 1.

The orders which will do this are:

\begin{addmargin}[1cm]{1em}%
\begin{lstlisting}
0 â†’ I
:DO(100)
AI + BI â†’ CI
I + 1 â†’ I
:REPEAT
\end{lstlisting}
\end{addmargin}

Initially $I = 0$ so that the order:-

\begin{addmargin}[1cm]{1em}%
\begin{lstlisting}
AI + BI â†’ CI
\end{lstlisting}
\end{addmargin}

will be:-

\begin{addmargin}[1cm]{1em}%
\begin{lstlisting}
A0 + B0 â†’ C0
\end{lstlisting}
\end{addmargin}

Before the loop is repeated $I$ is increased
by 1 so that the second time round the loop $I = 1$ and
the order is:-

\begin{addmargin}[1cm]{1em}%
\begin{lstlisting}
A1 + B1 â†’ C1
\end{lstlisting}
\end{addmargin}

This is repeated 100 times.  When the loop
is obeyed for the last time $I = 99$ so that the order is:-

\begin{addmargin}[1cm]{1em}%
\begin{lstlisting}
A99 + B99 â†’ C99
\end{lstlisting}
\end{addmargin}

\subsection{SUBROUTINES}

When writing a programme it is often
convenient to split up the program into a number of
distinct parts, each of which carries out a process
which is more or less an independent operation.  We
might also want to incorporate into our program a
procedure which has been written by someone else, for
example, a procedure to solve a set of linear
equations whose coefficients have arisen in the main
programme.  Procedures or programmes which are used
in this way are called \myuline{subroutines}.  Subroutines can
of course use other subroutines themselves etc.  A
programme which uses the subroutine is called its
\myuline{master}.  A flow diagram incorporating subroutines
might look like fig. \ref{fig:subfd}.

We have to make sure before the master
enters a subroutine that the variables which the
subroutine requires for its calculation have been set.
The subroutine must not ruin any information which the
master might want retained.

When a subroutine is being written, the
writer, in general, does not know in what context the
subroutine is going to be used, so that he cannot put
an instruction to pass control-back to a particular
master programme.  The return must therefore be
general.  In H-code we write the instruction

\begin{addmargin}[1cm]{1em}%
\begin{lstlisting}
:EXIT
\end{lstlisting}
\end{addmargin}

In the subroutine.  This has the effect of passing
control back to its master, whatever programme that
master might be.

If we wanted to use the procedure \mytt{XYZ} as a
subroutine and start obeying it at reference 3 (say)
we would write in the master the instruction

\begin{addmargin}[1cm]{1em}%
\begin{lstlisting}
:XYZ3
\end{lstlisting}
\end{addmargin}

When the instruction \mytt{:EXIT} is obeyed in the
subroutine control passes back to the master and the
computer obeys next the instruction immediately after
the instruction \mytt{:XYZ3}.  This is illustrated in fig.\ref{fig:scall}

(It should be emphasised that only a minimum
of the available facilities have been introduced.  The

EXAMPLE 1.
\end{flushleft}

The object of this is to solve a series of
quadratic equations whose coefficients are punched on
tape.  The roots, real and imaginary, are printed in
rows preceded by the serial number of the equation.

As the problem \myuline{must} be precisely defined, the
following information is given:-

\renewcommand{\labelenumi}{(\alph{enumi}).}
\begin{enumerate}

\item The coefficients of the general quadratic
equation $ax^{2} + bx + c = 0$ will be given on tape, in
the order a,b,c.

\item if the equation has two different real roots
we are to print "REAL" followed by the roots:-

\begin{math}
\frac{-b+\sqrt{b^{2}-4ac}}{2a}, \frac{-b-\sqrt{b^{2}-4ac}}{2a}
\end{math}

If equal roots print â€œEQUAL REAL" followed

by the double roots:
\begin{math}
\frac{-b}{2a}
\end{math}

If a = 0 print "SINGLE ROOT" followed by
solution of $bx + c = 0$ i.e. - $c/b$ unless in addition
b = 0 when print "NO SOLUTION'.

If complex roots print "COMPLEX" followed
by real and imaginary parts.

\begin{math}
\frac{-b}{2a}, \frac{\sqrt{4ac-b^{2}}}{2a}
\end{math}

\item Each solution is to be preceded by the serial
number of the equation.

\end{enumerate}

\begin{flushleft}
\myuline{Parameters}:
\end{flushleft}

As only capital letters are available on the
teleprinter, we have to allocate a letter (and
numerical suffix if necessary) to each variable and
integer to be used in the computation.  We shall use:-

\begin{tabular}{clcl}
Variable & \mytt{A}  & for & $a$ \\
   "     & \mytt{B}  &  "  & $b$ \\
   "     & \mytt{C}  &  "  & $c$ \\
   "     & \mytt{D}  &  "  & $b^{2} -4ac = D$ \\
   "     & \mytt{D1} &  "  & $\sqrt{D}$ \\
\end{tabular}

Integer \mytt{S} for $s$ the serial number of the current set of
coefficients.

The following points have not been explained
in the text.  Referring to fig. \ref{fig:ex1}:-

\renewcommand{\labelenumi}{\Alph{enumi}.}
\begin{enumerate}

\item Although we have referred to the programme
as both \mytt{SOLUTION OF QUADRATIC} and \mytt{SOLUTION}, in fact
the computer only reads up to the first 4 letters of a
name, any further letters being ignored.

\hspace{1em}Instead of using a separate line for each
order we can separate them with a comma.  In the case
of a title instruction the comma is implied.

\hspace{1em}The instruction \mytt{:CLOSE} indicates that the
procedure it follows is terminated.

\hspace{1em}The \mytt{:START} Instruction indicates that the
first order to be obeyed is that following reference 0
in procedure \mytt{SOLUTION}.  The first order of a
procedure is addressed as reference 0.

\hspace{1em}The \mytt{::} at the end of the programme sheet is
a device to stop the computer reading more tape.

\item The \mytt{)} at the end of the data sheet tells the
computer, in reading data, to stop,

\hspace{1em}Each item of data should be terminated by
at least 2 spaces or a new line.

A,B. In \ref{sec:ARITH} it was stated that numbers which are
variables should always have a decimal point.  Although
this is a rule which is always correct, there are
situations when it can be violated.  For example,
when a number follows a variable the computer knows
that the number represents a floating point quantity
therefore we can write \mytt{A*2} but we can \myuline{not} write \mytt{2*A}.

In data the variable in the \mytt{:READ} instruction
determines whether the data is to be fixed or floating
point, therefore no decimal point is necessary.

But if in doubt, use the decimal point.

\vspace{3mm}

Although this integral has an analytical
solution, namely

\begin{addmargin}[1cm]{1em}%
\begin{math}
z = \frac{1}{2d}\log_{e}\{\frac{d+b}{d-b}\dot\frac{d-a}{d+a}\}
\end{math}
\end{addmargin}


we shall for the sake of interest calculate it by using
this result and also by using a standard procedure which
calculates an integral by a method based on Simpson's
rule.  To use this procedure as a subroutine we do not
have to know how it works, it is sufficient to be given
the following information:-

\begin{description}
\item The name of the procedure is \mytt{SIMPSON}.
\item It has no references.
\item It uses the variables \mytt{A,B,Y,Y1,Y2,T,H,H1,S,E,X,Z,Z1}, and the integer \mytt{C}.
\item It is entered at reference 0 with the following variables set:-
\begin{description}
\item \mytt{A,B} as the limits of integration.
\item \mytt{E} as the accuracy to which the integration is to be performed.
\end{description}
\end{description}

It is obvious that \mytt{SIMPSON} must also be able
to calculate the dependent from the independent
variable, therefore we must define a subroutine which
calculates y given x where

\begin{addmargin}[1cm]{1em}%
\begin{math}
z = \int_{a}^{b} y \, dx
\end{math}
\end{addmargin}

\mytt{SIMPSON} becomes the master of this subroutine.  A
subroutine used in this way is called an \myuline{auxiliary}.

\mytt{SIMPSON} does not need to know the interval
of integration.  It calculates its own interval in
order to obtain the required accuracy.

\columnbreak

On leaving \mytt{SIMPSON} \mytt{Z} is the value of the
integral and \mytt{C} is the number of intervals into which
\mytt{SIMPSON} divides the range of integration to obtain the
required accuracy.

To illustrate how the number of intervals
increases with the increase in accuracy required we
are asked to print out the number of intervals and the
value of the integral for the error E = .1, .01, .001,
...... .00000001.  Finally we shall print out the
value of the integral calculated analytically.

\begin{flushleft}
\myuline{Parameters:}
\end{flushleft}

We shall use variables and suffices
corresponding to those in the mathematical statement
of the problem.

\begin{flushleft}
\myuline{The flow diagram}
\end{flushleft}

Shown in fig. \ref{fig:ex2fd}

\begin{flushleft}
\myuline{Notes on the print-out:}
\end{flushleft}

Referring to fig. \ref{fig:ex2}:-

A. The function \mytt{LOG} is $\log_{e}(x)$.  Other functions
available include \mytt{SIN}, \mytt{COS}, \mytt{TAN}, \mytt{ARCTAN}, \mytt{EXP}, \mytt{MOD}
(the modulus), \mytt{FRAC} (The fractional part).

The instruction \mytt{:STOP} is self-explanatory.

Note that the procedures can be "written' in
any order as the order of appearance in the programme
has no relation to the order in which they are obeyed.
