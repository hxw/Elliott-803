# TINS an African game with many names

It maybe based on the version called Kalah.

You set your move on F1 buttons (as a bit per pile, so 40 means left
most pile 01 means right most pile) then toggle LSB.  At the start if
you set no bits then toggle LSB then I think the computer makes the
first move.

Note: there are two versions of the MOVE function.

Either remove the :: after START or toggle word generator LSB to load the
replacement move.

Determining the difference is left as a exercise for the reader. An
understanding of both H-Code and Elliott 803 machine code is needed for
this.
