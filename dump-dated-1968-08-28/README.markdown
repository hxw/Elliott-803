# dump-28-8-68

An unknown program dated 1968-08-28

Possibly this modifies the H-Code compiler since it has `:READ2` and
`:READ3` which are not part of the normal compiler.  It is not known
if the H-Code Plus includes these functions.


This program outputs some of its text and has some legible tape so the
`.h-code` file is not really an accurate representation of the tape.
